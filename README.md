# youtube_scrape
Internal library for scraping youtube videos. Alternative to pafy, pytube, and youtube-dl. 

Insert the youtube playlist name and url and download to folder. Then, convert all videos to .mp4 format for further processing.

This is good for emotional labels (angry, happy, sad, etc.) to be further processed, or just any video with sounds that we'd like to look further into.
